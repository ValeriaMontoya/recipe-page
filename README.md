## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

By doing this challenge I practiced HTML and CSS fundamentals. Flexbox was an important tool to complete the project easily and mobile-first workflow was perfect to get the project done really fast.

Something I learned during the process is how to import font files without using Google Fonts links. Here's what I did:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Young Serif";
  src: url("../assets/fonts/young-serif/YoungSerif-Regular.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 400;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  src: url("../assets/fonts/outfit/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 400, 600, 700;
}
```
